# NgxBackForwardCache

Simulate the [browser back-forward cache feature](https://web.dev/bfcache/) in angular using a custom [Angular RouteReuseStrategy](https://angular.io/api/router/RouteReuseStrategy).

Per default all routes will be saved.
You can manually disable some routes using `disableNgxBackForwardCache`.
